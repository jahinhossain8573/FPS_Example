# FPS_Example

This project is an FPS Example being developed in Unreal Engine 4.27 using C++ for the most part. The primary goal for this project is to make it easier for developers to get started on their project quickly, and waste less time on the basic stuff in their FPS game.
I am currently using the FPS Assault Pack which costs 14.99$, but I will be replacing it further down the line.
